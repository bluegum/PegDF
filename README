An experienmental PEG grammar pdf parser

I hope PEG(Parser Expression Grammer) has got just enough power to describe
pdf file structure syntax. 
peg/leg parser/generater is required to build PegDF.

Steps to build:
1. download peg/leg source code.
2. "cd peg-0.1.4"
3. "make; make install"
4. "cd PegDF"
5. make
6. ./readpdf -o outfile infile
