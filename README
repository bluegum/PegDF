An experienmental PEG grammar pdf parser

PEG(Parser Expression Grammer) provided a succinct and expressive way
for parsing tasks. In fact it is so cool, makes yacc/lex look
so overkill on many small languages.

Pdf file structure syntax is considered a set rather elementary 
syntasis, mostly involving map parsing, map entry pairing, and
literal string parsing, etc. In these experiment, PEG grammar proved
to be very powerful for PDF constructs parsing. However,
performance could be better if some of the syntactical rules
made a little slopier and more compentent semantic handlers
to take some syntax analying role. For example, a nested PDF
string can be described by PDF in a formal way, and semantic
hooks need to flatten the tree, which is not the most
efficient method.

This project is writting in the original PEG syntax.
peg/leg parser/generater is required to build PegDF.

Steps to build:
1. download peg/leg source code.
2. "cd peg-0.1.4"
3. "make; make install"
4. "cd PegDF"
5. make
6. ./readpdf -o outfile infile

enjoy.
