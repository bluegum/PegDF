There are some utilities to be installed before you run "make", "make install".
For ubuntu, type in the followings:
sudo apt-get install gperf
sudo apt-get install nasm
sudo apt-get install cmake

"gperf" is used by PegDF to generate some hash tables.
"nasm" is required by "libjpeg-turbo"
"cmake" is required by "openjpeg"

Once those three are in system, simply run

make; sudo make install

Currently "make install" install PegDF utilities into /usr/local/bin.
readpdf, picker, and pedal are the PegDF utils to manipulate
pdf file.
